# 🏆  Npx Business Card

Basically a terminal based portfolio. (for nerds 🤓).

## 👨‍💻 Run my business card

```bash
npx adityastomar67
```

If you wish to reuse it, you can easily update the links in the `personal-info.json` file (the script will read from there 😄).

If you edit the script on your machine, you will have to run `npm link` to locally _symlink_ the package, and then run `pH7BioLinks` in your terminal.
